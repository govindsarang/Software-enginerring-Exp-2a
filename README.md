# Software Engineering – Experiment 2

## Title
**Weather Modelling Using Quadratic Equation Based on SDLC Models**

---

## Objective
The objective of this experiment is to study and implement **weather modelling** using a **quadratic mathematical model** by applying three different **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models**:
1. Waterfall Model  
2. Iterative Model  
3. Agile Model  

The implementation is done using the **Python programming language**.
